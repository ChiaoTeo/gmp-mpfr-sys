# Rust low-level bindings for GMP and MPFR

The `gmp-mpfr-sys` crate provides Rust low-level bindings for the
[GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library](https://gmplib.org/) (GMP)
and the [GNU MPFR Library](http://www.mpfr.org/), a library for
multiple-precision floating-point computations. The source of the two
libraries is included in the package.
